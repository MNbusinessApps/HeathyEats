# 🚀 Food Source App - GitHub Deployment Guide

## 📁 Your Deployment Package
I've organized your Food Source App into a clean folder structure:

### Essential Files:
- `index.html` - Main application (8.5KB)
- `js/analytics-engine.js` - Statistical analysis engine (20KB)
- `js/app.js` - App functionality (15KB)
- `README.md` - Documentation
- `css/` & `data/` folders (empty but ready for expansion)

## 🌐 GitHub Pages Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) → "New repository"
2. Repository name: `food-source-app`
3. **Set to Public** (required for free GitHub Pages)
4. **Don't initialize** with README (we have one already)
5. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Upload Files
**Option A: Drag & Drop (Easiest)**
1. In your new repo, click "uploading an existing file"
2. Drag all files from `food-source-deployment` folder
3. Commit message: "Initial Food Source App deployment"
4. Click "Commit changes"

**Option B: GitHub Web Interface**
1. Click "creating a new file"
2. Copy content from `index.html` → paste → name: `index.html`
3. Repeat for `js/analytics-engine.js` and `js/app.js`

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to repository Settings (tab at top)
2. Scroll to "Pages" in left sidebar
3. Under "Source" → "Deploy from a branch"
4. Select "main" branch → "/ (root)" folder
5. Click "Save"

### Step 4: Get Your Live URL
- GitHub will provide a URL like: `https://yourusername.github.io/food-source-app`
- **Wait 2-5 minutes** for deployment to complete
- Test the URL to confirm everything works!

## ✅ What Should Work
- Home screen with "Food Source" title
- NFL Props and NBA Props buttons
- Confidence percentages (0-100%, not 5000%)
- Working "View Analysis" buttons
- Real statistical breakdowns

## 🔧 File Structure (Final)

## 📞 Need Help?
If something doesn't work:
